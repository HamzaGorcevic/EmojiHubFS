                <h2>What is emoji? What does the word ‚Äúemoji‚Äù mean?</h2>
                <p>
                    "Emoji" is defined as any small images, icons, or symbols
                    used in text messages, social media, email, or any other
                    text fields in electronic communication. Users use them to
                    express their emotional attitude, give information quickly
                    and clearly, exchange messages playfully with no words, and
                    more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you know that the word "emoji" is made up of two Japanese
                    words: picture (e) and character (moji)? What a surprise,
                    right?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first emoji was created in 1999 by a Japanese man. His
                    name is Shigetaka Kurita.
                </p>
